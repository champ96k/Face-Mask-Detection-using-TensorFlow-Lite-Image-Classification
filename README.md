### Face Mask Detection :
Face Mask Detection system built with Flutter, TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams.

### 😇 Motivation
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.

### 📁 Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download](https://www.kaggle.com/sumansid/facemask-dataset)

This dataset consists of 2500+ images belonging to two classes:
  - with_mask: 1000+ images
  - without_mask: 1500+ images
  
The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:
  - Kaggle datasets
